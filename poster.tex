  % Intro/Motivation can be the importance of glob opt in many contexts including
  % FP error bounding and FP error bounding can be motivated via its relevance to
  % HPC code precision tuning
  Floating point computation is inherently flawed. Each operation carries with it an error term
  that, with many operations compounding, can cause tremendous error in the output. When using
  floating point arithmetic one must be aware of the magnitude of the error in the computation being
  done. This is where floating point error bounding comes into play. It can be used to give tight
  upper bounds to computations, such as those used in high powered computing. To power this bounding
  is global optimization utilizing interval arithmetic.

% Serial Algorithm
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\headerbox{Serial Algorithm}{name=BoxTwo, column=0, below=BoxOne}{
  The classical branch and bound algorithm utilizes the property of interval arithmetic that
  computation of a function over an interval gives an answer bound that is guaranteed to contain the
  real bounds of the function within the inputs given. A high water mark is used to store the highest
  lower bound seen, and if a given input produces an output which lies completely below this mark
  then the input can be discarded. Otherwise the input is split in half and this computation is
  repeated on each new input. An input will also be discarded if the maximum width is below a user
  set threshold. Once there are no more inputs to process the maximum of the function is tightly
  bounded by the highest upper output of the inputs which were discarded due to width tolerance.

% Parallel Algorithms
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\headerbox{Parallel Algorithms}{name=BoxThree, column=0, span=2, below=BoxTwo, above=bottom}{
  There is considerable shared state in the traditional algorithm. The high water mark, the inputs
  which are still to be processed, and the maximum as it is found. To mitigate the problems
  associated with shared state we experimented with various methods. One consisted of using parallel
  map functions on a list of the inputs to be process, each map produced a list of new inputs, a list
  of new high water marks, and a list of new solutions. The latter two were reduced to find the
  maximum and the process repeated. Another solver split the initial input into many pieces and sent
  those off to worker threads. When a worker thread finished work on it's input it would report back
  to the main thread with a new water mark and maximum, if found, and the main thread would in turn
  given the thread a new input to work on. If the new values were better than the main threads values
  an update would be issued to all worker threads to update their local values.

% Function complexity vs time graph

\headerbox{Function Complexity}{name=BoxFour, column=1, span=2}{
  \begin{tabular}{p{.95\linewidth-\graphWidth}p{\graphWidth}}
    The number of input variables to a function causes an exponential increase in the search space
    and solving time. There are tricks to tame this complexity. Partitioning the function into
    expressions which contain no overlapping variables is one example. The problem with these
    simplifications is that they only apply to a subset of input functions. If the function cannot
    be split into expressions it must be solved as a whole.

    Since there are multiple paths of inquiry when the parallel solvers are running there is a
    difference in the number of total loops involved. This indicates how smart and efficient each
    search strategy is. This is a more reliable method of comparing solvers than wall clock time.

\headerbox{Swig}{name=BoxSix, column=2, below=BoxFive, above=bottom}{
  To utilize existing libraries for performing interval arithmetic we used the MPFI library. To
  allow for quick prototyping we elected to use Python as the language for the main algorithm. In
  order to interface these two language we used the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, SWIG.
  This quick prototyping allowed leeway for ideas to be quickly tested before much work went into
  them. Python was never meant to be the end target, just a way to query the field of ideas quickly
  so a suitable algorithm could be found for the final product.

% Python Complications
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\headerbox{Python Complications}{name=BoxSeven, column=3}{
  The multiprocessing module for python has inconsistent costs for operations when compared to other
  languages. A shared Ctype variable is very fast while a shared variable of any other type is quite
  costly. For the latter to manage shared memory a process is used to pass information between the
  worker process. This is hidden from the programmer. Shared queues are far faster unless certain
  operators are used in sequence, such as placing multiple items in a queue then accessing the member
  variable not\_empty. While the flexibility to experiment with ideas was useful, there are some
  drawbacks.

% Move to Rust
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\headerbox{Move to Rust}{name=BoxEight, column=3, below=BoxSeven}{
  To aid in the overall speed of our optimization we are turning to Rust. This allows us to still
  leverage C and C++ interval libraries while having a more hospitable enviroment, due to the
  similarities between Rust and C. From our testing this has shown to be very promising.
